20-12-2016,5,"I had the pleasure of working with Wyndham Capital in September 2018 as my family and I were making a home purchase in Columbus, OH. From the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from Wyndham was very responsive and professional. I was VERY impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be",Wyndham Capital Mortgage

16-08-2016,5,Patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure I got the right loan for my situation. The portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. Very pleased with the customer service and intend on using Patrick again when we refinance later!!!!,Wyndham Capital Mortgage
04-09-2017,5,"I loved working with this group of people! They laughed with me over the phone! Always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! Knowledgeable staff! While we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed Wyndham, they lost my business because of it. When I told Wyndham about it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the ""sell""",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
22-03-2016,5,Great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. Quick responses to any questions or concerns. Willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren't always an option for us.,Wyndham Capital Mortgage
02-04-2017,5,"Working with Michelle and Wyndham went really well for me. As a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, I feel that this process was smooth and successful. I will definitely recommend Michelle to friends and family.",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
06-02-2016,5,"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
11-06-2016,5,Jay was easy to get a hold of if I had any questions so that was huge to me because there's a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything's right. He provided as great a service as I could've wanted,Wyndham Capital Mortgage

06-11-2016,5,"Chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. Again, cannot say enough positive things about Chaz. Consummate professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
03-07-2016,5,Austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. He explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the B.S other companies use to get your business . Being a repeat customer says it all.,Wyndham Capital Mortgage
07-10-2016,5,The salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him I'm looking for a heloc specifically. Then he hangs up on me because I said I was quoted a better rate at TD bank. Ridiculous....,Wyndham Capital Mortgage
24-02-2017,1,"This was the worst experience ever. It was like they had never gone through the process before. I could not get a complete list of the documents required. Every other day it was a new request. The appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes I had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. Wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. There were many documents that I had to send 3 and 4 times because they ""lost"" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. I would NEVER use them. Awful experience!",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
14-03-2016,1,"A good rate but a very frustrating process, constant delays, decisions made then changed, overwhelmed underwriting team with 3 week back log, rookie mistake related to Texas law that caused an additional 2 week wait. Closing happened almost 6 weeks after it should have. Courteous and professional, but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency. Would not recommend",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
13-08-2017,1,"They were not upfront. Learn from my mistake... I trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the Good Faith Estimate with higher rate plus lender's credit. After running my numbers, the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now, I'm being charge points. It looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lender",Wyndham Capital Mortgage
26-06-2016,1,"Initially, the Mortgage Broker was very friendly and assertive. Once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent, it became increasingly difficult to reach the broker. I had to initiate all phone calls. It seemed as if I had to call to make the process move forward. It took four weeks to get a copy of my closing documents and the payoff for my credit card",Wyndham Capital Mortgage

Ours was a complicated process with a refinance and a loan and they hung in there with us the entire time. It was a great experience working with both of them. I highly recommend them and will use them in the future for all of my mortgage needs",North American Savings Bank
11-10-2017,5,"Kory was by far the best loan officer I have ever worked with. We were dealing with a complicated refinance and purchase of two different properties and he was cool, calm, professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I wouldn’t use anyone else moving forward. His level of integrity and responsiveness is second to none. Thanks for everything, Kory",North American Savings Bank
14-10-2016,5,"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him. ",North American Savings Bank
08-01-2016,5,"The NASB team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important VA home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging Antebellum home that required the entire NASB team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough VA process. I truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. I will only recommend NASB for home loans...especially complicate VA loans",North American Savings Bank
22-10-2016,5,"Dallas Goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. He was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. We were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. It was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like Dallas. Great job!",North American Savings Bank
12-09-2017,5,"Comments: To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat NASB but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose NASB because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. Dallas Goodlet/ Brent Custer and the whole NASB team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. We are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. Kudos to all ",North American Savings Bank
24-05-2017,5,"Working with Jon was such an amazing experience! From the start he offered answers to any questions I had since after all this was our first home purchase! Jon was always a phone call away ready to help where needed. He made the stringent home buying process as easy as possible! I would definitely recommend any potential buyers to work with Jon, I know for myself I will be calling him if we ever decide to buy another house! Thanks Jon",North American Savings Bank
02-05-2017,5,NASB was amazing to work with! The pre-approval process was easy and informational. We chose our home and closed within 30 days of our agreement date! Thanks NASB for making our first home purchase an amazing experience!,North American Savings Bank

10-02-2017,5,"I can't express how incredibly awesome our experience was with working with Bryant Small at NASB. As a military family, we have purchased or refinanced many homes and this was by far the BEST experience we have ever had. Bryant makes it easy and took the time to discuss the best options for us. I've never met Bryant, but you can't mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and NASB were who we were going with. ",North American Savings Bank

It has been several years since we've gone thru the home loan process and we were unsure where to start. After talking with Adam, we were confident he was the one to help us with our refi.

He made the entire process easy and was very knowledgeable. The closing on this home was seamless, no surprises. I would definitely recommend Alex Madewell and NASB to anyone looking for a mortgage.",North American Savings Bank
30-01-2016,5,Rob was very helpful in getting this loan closed. Few issues on our end we didn't know about but he was still able to get it done on time.,North American Savings Bank

05-05-2016,5,"Adam came highly recommended and from the first time we spoke with him, it was clear why. He was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and worked hard to ensure we were taken care of in all aspects. Beyond the necessary effective communication skills, he brought a personal touch after we closed by sending us a hand written note of congratulations. I will recommend him to everyone I know buying a house.",North American Savings Bank
09-05-2017,1,"The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly. But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster. I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran ",North American Savings Bank
13-08-2017,1,Miserable experience. They screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors. I wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home.,North American Savings Bank
24-12-2017,1,"Our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed. Once we committed he only communicated with us AFTER I questioned items and problems and AFTER I questioned why we weren't settling before our rate lock expired. We had no idea where we were in the process unless I contacted Steve. Poor, poor communication. Mr. Kang also was ""sure"" our house would appraise for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn't end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage. Our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot. He used poor comps. We were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on (within minutes of the email notifications). Only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary (and thank goodness we were done). Poor process, poor communication - we will NEVER recommend NASB and I have already told two people refinancing to steer clear. ",North American Savings Bank
10-02-2017,1,"Started refinance with Nick things were going OK then there was a problem with a credit card fro 5 years earlier, which must of made the loan not possible. This I would of understood, But I never heard from them again? called Nick several times no response? I even called his supervisor no response? E-Mailed them no response? IS THIS THE COMPANY YOU WANT TO DUE BUSNESS...",North American Savings Bank
20-05-2016,1,"This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star",North American Savings Bank

15-01-2016,1,"It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them.

12-09-2017,1,"Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch",North American Savings Bank

We were initially pretty skeptical about refinancing our home.  We’ve had personal and family issues that devastated our credit to the point where we felt that it would be a waste of time since we’d never be approved.  However, a real need arose when Dad’s declining health demanded we make room in our home so we can keep him close to us and give him the care he needs.  We weren’t sure what to expect from Patrick G at Reliance, but we were soon reassured and thoroughly delighted when Pat informed us that we were eligible and that he’d walk us through the entire process personally!  There simply are no superlatives sufficient to thank you for your fantastic guidance in getting our home refinanced!  You took what we assumed would be a challenging home refinance and successfully navigated us through the process to a successful conclusion.  In every single step, you proved to be friendly, patient, polite, knowledgeable, professional and consistently available to us.   We can't remember the last company we dealt with that returned calls and emails in such a timely manner!  You even personally called on weekends when there were items that needed our attention!

Buyer beware!! To make it short and sweet, shop around and find someone who knows what they are talking about. 
There were certain expenses that I had to pay before closing, but was assured I would get a refund, or Reliance would pay for it and it would reflect in the final closing documents. This did not happen. 
Termite inspection required by VA, was $100+. I was told I would get this back. Nope. Her answer, 'Oh, the rules changed some time back, and I didn't know about it'. 
Was also told, if it closed late, which it did, Reliance would pick up the late fee for my present mortgage which she told me not to pay. Yep, they paid it, with my proceeds!!
Then to pay off the loan, which was the reason for the refinance, they send me a check payable to the lender, and then I have to overnight it to the lender so i don't get hit with another late fee. WHY??? Could't they just do an electronic payment.

The experience with Reliance was extremely frustrating and aggravating. First the loan ""mgr"" asked for the usual pile of paper, including the 4506T to prove I paid my taxes. Fine, but then they wanted copies of my tax returns so they could compare. Since when are they tax auditors? Unable to find the copy for 2011, I had the IRS send us the transcript of it, and sent it via PO, and electronically. But then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us, and not the IRS. Now we are getting ridiculous. So we had the IRS fax it to them directly, AND STILL they had a problem with it's ""authenticity"". They received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and ""dummy up"" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. We said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. Amazing that a week later they finally approved it. This guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our Christmas trip to Dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. And to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying ""Does that make sense?"", after every statement, as if I couldn't understand basic English. One of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior. They requested the 4506T 4 more times, so we sent them at least 8 to make sure. So that didn't ""make sense"", nor did their inability to accept the IRS transcripts sent from the IRS, nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in Dallas over Christmas. I certainly would not want my friends to feel my frustration... Read More

We will certainly be recommending you to friends, as will our realtor, and we look forward to using your company for any future refinancing or home purchases in the future.

I am writing this review to share what ended up being an unpleasant experience with Kirk Gay and Pacific Beneficial Mortgage to other potential customers. 

I am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan, but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate, so I used LendingTree which is how Kirk contacted me. My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. I stated that I wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that be to see what he could do. I never heard from him. I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews. It was only then that I received an email from Kirk accusing me of extorting him. I want other potential customers to know about what occurred as not only was I misled, but I was treated terribly as a customer once Kirk had been paid his commission. It is extremely disappointing that this brokerage would go to these lengths over $525 after the fact when they promised this a customer.

Probably this was a more challenging refinance. Alex Zelada worked very had on this!
But despite numerous assurances of getting close to the finish line, it took over 3 months , and the 45 day rate lock had to be extended.
Most of the problem seemed to be with Quicken. Requests for documents was piecemeal, and each new request caused a delay; this most likely due to Quicken, and Q did put everything in a holding pattern, apparently without the brokers' knowledge. It was discovered only after my following up to see what the delay was .
Also there were a few instances of PB staff not fully reading thru correspondence and making assumptions that weren't entirely accurate and could have been significant to the borrower.

If doing it over I would go with a local broker with a comparable rate... Read More

After my application was filed and the rate was locked, they sent me an application to review which had many errors and then it took them over forever to make corrections. I emailed and called to inquire about the status of my loan and it took nearly a week to get a reply. I emailed again later to ask when an appraisal would be ordered, and almost another week went by before I got a reply. Poor communication with customers .Even though I applied with another lender the very same week I applied with Pacific, I was asked to sign docs with that other lender before an appraisal was even ordered by Pacific!!

This company responded to my Lending Tree application, and I picked them out to work with because their initial e-mails were polite and professional. I spoke with a broker Adam and explained my somewhat complicated situation. He advised me to send financial documents (including 1040s, W2s, etc) so his folks could make a preliminary decision before I started an applicaiton. I immediately sent him all the HIGHLY personal paperwork he requested. A few days later he e-mailed once saying ""everything looks good but we need to be sure"", and after that, he never e-mailed, called, or notified me via mental telepathy. I e-mailed requesting an update, but NOTHING.... ARGHHH... Why did you waste my time? If your company couldn't help me, no biggie, just tell me!

Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals.

She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business!  

Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded NASB team (also stellar!) to support your needs.  He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies).  Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the NASB team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees.

I can't recommend anyone more for your lending needs when working with a VA loan, you need a loan officer who ""knows"" what they are doing. He is great at what he does and will personally ensure your closing is on time. Even with an extremely slow appraiser who did not meet deadlines causing delays, we still closed on time thanks to RC, his professionalism and his dedication to keep his word.

Very smooth experience.....working with a VA loan, closing on time, NASB was extremely easy to work with. As a veteran, you WANT a lender who understands and easily funds VA loans and NASB meets this requirement with five stars. Other lenders we have worked with in the past do not meet NASB's service, especially closing on time, in my experience. Recommend highly!

The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly.  But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster.

I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website.  Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries.

For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled.  However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited.

NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services.  When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current.

Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department.  

The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me.  The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything.

After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service.  I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran... Read More

This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More

I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation... Read More

The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check.

Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end.

But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails.

I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning.

The Interest rate offered and time to close being short sold us on the loan so we pursued it despite -
1. the fact that a credit check and underwriting was made when per VA rules for an IRRRL these were not necessary and we were assured by Mr. Owens when first discussing the refinancing they would not be made. 
2. the constant errors in the paperwork. One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds. Another was not classifying the currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in December just a month later during the time NASB intended to sell the mortgage. Thankfully this was corrected by the Closing Agent.
3. Mr. Owens not being straight with us about NASB's intent to sell the mortgage after closing. His statements of first saying NASB would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the Loan Estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there ""just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future."" Since today, just 5 days after disbursement, I find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows Mr. Owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn't definite. 
4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial Closing Document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior to arrival at the Closing Agent's place of business.
Pros allow for the Neutral instead of bad rating because the ""despites"" show that the customer support during this loan process was extremely poor and unacceptable.

05-05-2016,1,"
Good News:

The $995 processing fee was waived.
The rate was locked for 35 days but they closed in 9 weeks, I did not have to pay for an extension.
They have also floated my rate down 1/8 percent without any fees.
Until the closing I did not pay anything other than a credit history check fee.

Not so good news:

This was a very long and frustrating experience.
I do believe that the process took longer than expected mostly because of the busy refinance season.
I might be a difficult customer or may be just unlucky but there was always a problem with every stage and detail of my refinance experience.
I am trying not to blame the ""loan consultant"" (BYRON HOUSWORTH) for this.

Whenever I asked about any time line, the answer was fixed ""in a week or so"". I had to wait for 9 (nine) weeks to close.

It was my luck that his vacation week was in the middle of my process.

If NASB needs a document they will wait until the last minute and then come back ""oh we need this document or else we can't continue""
When you have that one taken care of, they will wait ""a week or so"" to get back to you and next week you will hear ""it turns out we also need this document""
This went on and on, the day before the closing they would email me and say ""we just noticed that we didn't have your employment verification done"", hours before closing,
""oh we just found out that we don't have your home insurance verification and we can't reach them""
I called the insurance company and in ten minutes it was taken care of.

I don't know how many times I had to hear ""this should be OK"" and turns out it is not OK.

Many many times they assured me they have all the information they need - but this was never the case.

They were not very careful, they missed out all the details, they wasted weeks and weeks because they were not able to go through a check list and see if they have taken care of everything.

They always say ""we are too busy with a lot of applications"". I believe they shouln't accept applications that they can't process.

Sample communication:

me: Why am I being charged for such and such?
respond: We are not charging you for that.
me: Please check the final HUD line XX
respond: Sorry I didn't go down that far.
me: ???

Some of my favorite quotes from them:
""Sorry! Don't come across this too often. ""
""Wasn't aware of that...""
""This should work.""
""Can you possibly call them again? We need it ASAP.""
""Thank you for your patience.""
""TGIF!"" --(I had to hear this 8-9 times)

They are not bad people, but you need a lot of patience dealing with them.

Do I suggest working with them?
Only if you are not under any time pressure.
Only if you can work hard for your own application.
Only if you have a lot of patience.

This closing went pretty smooth with the exception of a few bumps. The customer service agent was prompt with responses as well as document transfers. I was not keen on doing a refinance all electronic through email and phone, but I have to say, the process was easy and went well. I got a great rate and the closing costs were good.

The only issue I had was at closing, the final documents were written for a 30 year loan and it was suppose to be a 25 year loan, An issue happened at the final writing so I did not close on the specified closing date, it happened a day later after the papers were rewritten. It was great they were able to resolve it in one day, the bad part was I got charged a rate lock extension fee as my rate lock expired on the day I was suppose to close. I am sure I could have fought them on the fee as it was caused because of their mistake but now I was closing on New years eave and did not want to carry the closing over to the new year...

I was trying to decide between Triumph Lending and a much larger company whose name starts with a Q and they have a spaceship logo.  I'm so happy I went with Triumph.  The other company got all needy and wouldn't stop trying to call me once I chose Triumph.  However, Triumph didn't play any games with me, they responded more quickly, they took the time to educate me, didn't use any gimmicky sales techniques, and were pleasant to work with through the whole process.  I'm so happy with their work, that I'm going to use them again when I buy a rental property next year. ... Read More

This was my first home purchas; however, with Peter and Monica’s support, they made this such an easy and smooth process.  I always hear about the stress and challenges when buying a house, but the day Peter called and told me we were all good to go and would be closing in a couple weeks I laughed and honestly thought he was joking.  That’s how simple and quick they were with my loan; I was actually able to enjoy the entire process from application to closing.   Their response time to emails was unbelievable; you would have a response within minutes at almost all hours of the day.  All in all, they exceeded the bar with customer service (would of given them 100 stars if it was option), were extremely fast in the loan process, got me an outstanding rate, and continued to call all the way through closing to make sure everything was going well!  If you’re in the market to buy a home or refinance Peter and his team are the ones for you.  Thank you so much for all you did, I can never thank you enough!  All the best to you... Read More

I had a good gut feeling about Triumph Lending, but I wasted a lot of time checking with a few other mortgage companies.

Those other companies were all over the map. There were two I never heard back from after the pre-approval stage. One of them completely ignored one an email I sent as a follow up to a phone call. Another waited a month to call me back. Two of them promised information and ever provided it.

The real prize winner was particularly pushy and was completely unprofessional when I informed him I had decided to use Triumph lending because they're closing costs were thousands of dollars lower.

But everyone I worked with at Triumph, mostly Vanessa Flores (Loan Officer) & Alina Vargas (Loan Processor), took every question seriously, never failed to respond to a request (quickly and accurately), and I know it sounds cliche, but I felt like I was more than just a number to them.

First time doing a refi completely online. We have owned several properties for over 40 years. DLJ Senior Mortgage Banker Jaclyn M and Maribel N were both courteous, professional, knowledgeable to every extent and made this choice with DLJ, one we wish we had for every property purchase or refi we made in the past. Seemless and delivered on every promise made on day one. We couldn't have been happier for the service they provided and the manner in which they provided it. 5 Star all the way around.

ANTHONY MARROQUIN was my primary Senior Mortgage Banker. Anthony patiently and thoroughly fully explained everything to me step by step from start to finish while exploring all options for the best results. I went with DLJ because of Anthony - his individualized care, his competence, and his commitment to making all the right stuff happen. As anyone who is in the financing market knows, when you begin to research options you are swamped by endless phone calls and texts from dozens of companies all offering everything - but usually not disclosing the downsides or hidden fees. Anythony is so savvy, financially creative, thoughtful, and thorough that I chose to work with him and DLJ versus any other company. Anthony walked me through all the steps and requirements from beginning to successful finish. Thus my 5 stars for Anthony.

Recently, I successfully financed a home loan through DLJ Financial and  Senior Mortgage Banker Anthony Marroquin. I had discovered that traditional banks and online financing companies were impossible for me to work with because they held against me my record of variable income (I am a self-employed freelancer and a multi-Emmy-winning Reality TV producer who works for more than a decade on a #1 major network series.) However, DLJ carefully evaluated everything, treated me as a unique person rather than just a bunch of standard numbers to be crunched and averaged, and they made it all happen - straightforwardly, fully explained, and with no glitches.

What you look for in a company is one that is going to handle all that for you, and work to your best interest, as well as present ideas to you that you may not have known were options. Once your strategy is underway, you want communication, updates and overall insight as to how the process is going, and those three things should happen easily and in a non-invasive way.

I spent weeks working with numerous brand name banks and lending intuitions to refinance my home. I assumed this came after a particularly opportune time, as I just completed a full cycle in my full-time employment position. I had all the documents uploaded within a day or 2.  My income, credit score, 401K balances were all quite respectable. However, rather than being met with the highest degree of professionalism, I was met with stumbling blocks of bureaucracy.

Then I was very fortunate to find Michael and his most dedicated professional staff at Guaranteed Rate. I was prepared once again for anything, other than the professionalism, sensitivity, and quick (and at the same time responsible) turnaround I immediately received.

The closing costs, title insurance, etc. were the lowest I have ever seen.

I closed this week, original mortgage paid off, money in my account, all with the most respectable and free flowing experience imaginable.

This process was simple and straight-forward.  Unlike other lenders we were not continually ask to provide the same documentation repeatedly.  We were very happy with how quickly and easily the loan took from start to finish.  The loan officer Matthew McDevitt was available when needed, but not overbearing.  We had a previous poor experience with a lender that made numerous promises, even in writing, and then as closing approached changed the deal in dramatic fashion, which was caused us to eventually decide not to move forward.  This deal happened faster than anticipated with literally no hang-ups.  We would totally recommend Guaranteed Rate. To those that question using an online lender, several trusted sources pointed us in this direction, but in fairness we considered that we don't really personally know our local banker either and lack of face-to-face interaction does not stop all types of business we take part in daily. We hope to never have to move again, but when we are ready to finance, we will check Guaranteed Rate again.

I assumed this came after a particularly opportune time, as I just completed a full cycle in my full-time employment position. I had all the documents uploaded within a day or 2.  My income, credit score, 401K balances were all quite respectable. However, rather than being met with the highest degree of professionalism, I was met with stumbling blocks of bureaucracy.

Then I was very fortunate to find Michael and his most dedicated professional staff at Guaranteed Rate. I was prepared once again for anything, other than the professionalism, sensitivity, and quick (and at the same time responsible) turnaround I immediately received.

The closing costs, title insurance, etc. were the lowest I have ever seen.

I closed this week, original mortgage paid off, money in my account, all with the most respectable and free flowing experience imaginable. 

Thank you, Michael and crew.

A friend of mine told me that he just refinanced his house for an unbelievable interest rate and I wanted to find out what the rates were in the market. I was a little skeptical about how this online process of finding the mortgage refinancing works, but Joe Dilucchio of Guaranteed Rate was fantastic to deal with. He was super helpful, friendly and ensured that he answered all my questions to ensure that we werent wasting each other's time.  Joe provided different types of options, patiently explained all of them and went through pros and cons and most importantly didnt try and and sell me anything.  I have met enough folks who will try and force an option on you and want you to buy.  Joe's attitude of building relationships instead of selling a deal really resonated with me and I will certainly recommend Joe to anyone who in interested in financing or refinancing option and will certainly reach out to him for my financing needs in the future...

While William was fine, my loan officer, and was at times very good; this entire experience was horrible when it came down to the actual processing and closing. The underwriter did not tell me about additional items needed until the very last week before closing, and I feel that she should have been able to give me that list when I called to check status 2 to 2 1/2 weeks prior. At that point I was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal. I live in Hawaii and buying here means that there is a 4 day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual. The items she was demanding would take 10-14 business days to get and I had already purchased my airline ticket, shipped my vehicle and household goods. There was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of GOD and I would have to bow her will. The company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes I had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare. They only care when it comes to getting your MONEY! With buying being stressful as it is, this was uncalled for from the companies side and they need to reevaluate their processes and get the understanding of what real customer service is- it is RESPECT of the customer and their time and lives!

Worse part is it takes on average 3-days for anyone there to follow-up to my phone call. My loan mgr Daniel Dunlop stopped working with me because he said he wasn't making enough money from my loan and was pulled off, this was after weeks of not hearing from anyone to find out what was going on with my loan.

Positive: Completed mortgage refinance reducing my APR from 5.25% to 3.5%

However: The 3.5% rate was available at several competitors, several of whom offered lower fees. I was also refinancing to reinstate my VA Certificate of Eligibility toward purchase of a home. Since the rate was available elsewhere, I hired GR based on the broker's claim that the transaction could be completed within 4-5 weeks or less. I formally began the process with Guaranteed Rate on July 2. Based on broker feedback that the transaction was in underwriting on July 23rd, we planned the closing date on our new home purchase for 1 month later and I alerted VA. This refinance didn't close with GR until a full month later (Aug 23) and the loan was funded on Aug 27. I came within 2 days of missing a rate-lock date on the other new-home purchase mortgage because of this.

Communications from the broker was horrible. As I mentioned, in parallel with this effort, I was going through the process of obtaining a home purchase mortgage from another company, so I have a great basis of comparison. I received no information from Guaranteed Rate without having to ask for it. When I did receive information, it was minimal (typically ""yes"" or ""no"" answer), so I had to follow-up with additional questions to get clarification on details (I don't do this for a living, that's why I hired GR! I definitely did NOT receive my money's worth).

If I'm to believe the broker, my loan package spent 4 1/2 weeks in underwriting. BTW, my credit scores are all above 770, so there was no issue there. When asked, the broker never offered any rationale for the delay.

When asked by GR, I sent this same review two weeks ago. Surprise - I haven't heard a word back from them apologizing for their complete lack of customer service.

I am new to home buying. Before I make such a huge decision, I like to ask lots of questions, including questions about how mortgages work. I want to make sure I am informed enough to at least have a shot at making an intelligent decision.

I had asked similar questions of several other lenders who contacted me through this site and they were all very polite and happy to answer my questions. Aaron however, seemed to have an attitude from the moment I picked up the phone and appeared to become more annoyed as I asked more questions.

His general tone was one of rudeness and condescension. The conversation ended, when Aaron cut me off in the middle of a question and said ""well let me ask you this, what didn't you understand about what I just said?"" At that point I informed him that our conversation was over and I would not be doing business with his company.

I'm not sure why Aaron and Guaranteed Rate, Inc. think it’s acceptable to treat people this way, but if you have expectations similar to mine, you may disappointed with their service.

I was ""pre-approved"" by Guaranteed Rate after they had all of my information, including an extensive application and full access to my credit information. Of course, I stopped dealing with other lenders who had made offers. I then entered into a months-long process of responding to multiple requests for documentation; everything had been clearly spelled out in my application, but they needed corroboration. Whenever I sent something, they would call a few days later and say that ""Underwriting"" required something else; and that it was all on account of the new govt. regulations. (And note that I was looking to consolidate the 1st and 2d mortgages on my home, and that the total I was asking for was less than 25% of my home's value.)

Finally, I received a call from my loan contact saying that my credit card balance was too high, and they couldn't give me a loan unless I paid it off first. This was information they had had all along, before they ""pre-approved"" me. In fact, my primary reason for re-financing was to get my monthly mortgage payments lower and to pay off that credit card balance. I basically said that their response was not acceptable; and we eventually got it done. However, I would never recommend them.

The only thing I would give them high points for is responsiveness. At least until I agreed to go with them, they got back to me quicker than anyone. I didn't go with 2 other lenders who were offering similar rates because they weren't getting back to me as fast as Gauranteed Rate. Once I went with them, however, the process dragged on for months; and they almost weren't going to give me the loan. Buyers Beware... Read More

I worked with Kory Klossner, a loan officer with NASB.  After confirming he could offer a much lower rate than my financial institution, he then took the additional time to explain the pros and cons of different loan types (conventional versus VA loans).  Kory also took the time to calculate approximate monthly payments and closing costs for each.  I never felt like I was being pressured or rushed into a decision, in fact I felt quite the opposite.  He gave me whatever time I needed to fully understand my options and make the choice that was right for me, based upon my unique circumstances.  Kory went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable with what has been the biggest financial decision of my life.  Thanks Kory...5 stars... Read More

I couldn't have been more pleased with Aaron's customer service. My father recommended Aaron when I was looking to buy a house. Aaron fought to get me the best rate and made sure that everything went as planned. When I wasn't able to move my closing date up to keep my rate interest rate, Aaron told me not to worry about it and he would cover the cost difference. He did the same thing when we had to pay extra to rush the appraiser to close on time. I would and will recommend Aaron to anyone looking to buy a home because I know he will do a great job like he did for me.... Read More

I can't recommend anyone more for your lending needs when working with a VA loan, you need a loan officer who ""knows"" what they are doing. He is great at what he does and will personally ensure your closing is on time. Even with an extremely slow appraiser who did not meet deadlines causing delays, we still closed on time thanks to RC, his professionalism and his dedication to keep his word.

Our refinance process was a dream once we spoke with Dallas, and chose him and his bank.  My husband spoke to quite a few lenders and when we got on the phone with Dallas, our choice was firm.

Dallas was so patient and understanding with us.  We had to snail mail all of the documents, we had a million questions for him, and he was a professional the entire time.

The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly.  But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster.

I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website.  Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries.

For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled.  However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited.

NASB sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services.  When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current.

Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department.  

The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me.  The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything.

After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service.  I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran... Read More

This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More

I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation... Read More

Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end.

But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails.

I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning.
